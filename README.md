# CVIntelligence
A parser that can generate a standard CV from possible file sources like .DOC, .DOCX, .HTML, .TXT, .RTF or .PDF.
I first started to do this project for a coding contest four days before the submission. I wanted the challenge. Although I knew such a challenge normally needs more than four days, I set aside some hours to work on it. During this time I realized the beauty of the problem and the kind of solution it needs. As I can see it, the solution for this problem is more likely from the arteficial intelligence world that is why I called it CVIntelligence. <b>Hey there may be we can make this a cool cloud service.

# Documentation
CVIntelligence is done with ASP.NET MVC5(C#). Most of the client side is done with the famous AngularJS framework. With the coming of the next version of ASP.NET vNEXT(MVC6) as an openspurce project itself makes this project a good opensource candidate.I hope!!

# CVIntelligence
<b>A parser that can generate a standard CV from possible file sources like .DOC, .DOCX, .HTML, .TXT, .RTF or .PDF.</b>
I first started to do this project for a coding contest four days before the submission. I wanted the challenge. Although I knew such a challenge normally needs more than four days, I set aside some hours to work on it. During this time I realized the beauty of the problem and the kind of solution it needs. As I can see it, the solution for this problem is more likely from the arteficial intelligence world that is why I called it CVIntelligence. <b>Hey there may be we can make this a cool cloud service.

#Documentation
CVIntelligence is done with ASP.NET MVC5(C#). Most of the client side is done with the famous AngularJS framework. With the coming of the next version of ASP.NET vNEXT(MVC6) as an openspurce project makes this project a good opensource candidate.I hope!!

I started out with .HTML file types. <b>Does any one want to build a CV in html? Unless He is a geek, like you and me:)</b> Working with html is fun,it gave me a considerable knowledge. 

All it does by now is upload .html files and try to find for the keywords predefined for every possible CV attributes then it returns the best it can. I know it doesn't do much but that is how everything starts!! See it live on http://cvintelligence.azurewebsites.net/
